# Description
* A framework using Harmony and Humanoid Alien Races (HAR) to allow for inorganic and unnatural beings ranging from elementals and ethereals to constructs and robots.

## Features
* This mod itself has the bare minimum code necessary to have artificial beings. It includes no tangible content and exists solely for other mods to leverage to make their own.
* An extensive mod settings page allowing for reconfiguring various races as artificial and settings for controlling various aspects of artificial pawns.

## Known Issues / Incompatibilities
* Activating Self-Tend on an artificial pawn will throw a message at you complaining that the Doctor work type is not assigned even if the pawn has the Artificer work type assigned (It's harmless, artificial pawns will self-tend based on Artificer, not Doctor).
